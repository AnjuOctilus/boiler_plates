         <p style="font-size:14px; padding:0px 0px; color:#45484f; margin-top:0px; text-align:right;">

                  My date of birth is {{date("d-m-Y", strtotime($user_data['user_dob']))}} </p></li>

                  <p style=" padding-left:20px; margin:0px;">
                  Although I have entered into various financial arrangements during the course of my life, I do not consider
                     myself to be particularly literate in financial matters.
                  </p></li> 
                  <li style="margin-top:10px;"> 
                  <p style="color:#45484f; margin:0px; padding-left:20px;">
                  The Claim arises out of the sale of a credit product and associated Payment Protection Insurance Policy
                  (“PPI Policy”) with the Defendant, for a credit facility.
                  </p></li> 
                  <li style="margin-top:10px;"> <p style="color:#45484f; margin:0px; padding-left:20px;">
                 I have been told by my solicitors, that the percentage amount which was to be paid as commission, was in
                     excess of 50%. Therefore, if I would have been advised by the Defendant of the amount which was to be
                     paid as commission, I would not have agreed to purchase the PPI policy. I would have strongly suspected
                     that it was not in my best interests to purchase the PPI policy given that so little of it went towards funding
                     the insurance itself.
                  </p></li> 
                  
                  <li style="margin-top:10px;"> 
                  <p style="color:#45484f; margin:0px;padding-left:20px;">
                  Furthermore, my solicitors have informed me that it is highly likely that the Defendant operated a scheme
                     whereby it would receive further financial benefit from the funds received from me. I understand (from my
                     solicitors), that this is referred to as a ‘profit-share’ scheme.
                  </p></li> 
                  <li style="margin-top:10px;"> 
                  <p style="color:#45484f; margin:0px; padding-left:20px;">
                  I was never told by the Defendant that any profit-share scheme existed. If I had any idea about the extent
                  of the financial benefit (including the commission and any additional profit-share benefit) that the
                  Defendant received, then I would never have considered purchasing the PPI policy.
                  </p></li> 
                  <li style="margin-top:10px;"> 
                  <p style="color:#45484f; margin:0px; padding-left:20px;">
                 Further, following non-disclosure of PPI commissions and profit share, I incurred a debt for PPI sums and
                     interest which was added to the sums owed under the agreement.  
                  </p></li> 
                  <li style="margin-top:10px;">
                   <p style="color:#45484f; margin:0px; padding-left:20px;">
                 The Defendant could have communicated at any point the commission and or profit share each occasion
                     that it sent or shared a credit statement and never did so or deliberately choose not to.
                  </p></li> 
                  <li style="margin-top:10px;"> 
                  <p style="color:#45484f; margin:0px; padding-left:20px;">
                 Even when the policy ended, I continued to incur economic loss as my credit balance contained
                     compounded interest directly related to the PPI.
                  </p></li> 
                

                  <li style="margin-top:10px;">
                  <p style="color:#45484f; margin:0px; padding-left:20px;">
                 I understand that vulnerability factors may be taken into account in my case. The following vulnerability
                      factors apply:
                  </p> </li>
                  <ol type="a" style="color:#45484f; margin:10px 0px; ">
                     <li style="margin-top:10px;">
                     <p style="color:#45484f; margin:0px; padding-left:20px;">
                     I was not financially sophisticated or experienced;
                     </p>
                     </li>
                     <li style="margin-top:5px;">
                     <p style="color:#45484f; margin:0px; padding-left:20px;">
                     I was not aware of the many factors to consider in respect of financial products (such as PPI),
                     particularly in terms of how to assess if the product on offer is priced fairly; and
                     </p>
                     </li>
                     <li style="margin-top:5px; ">
                     <p style="color:#45484f; margin:0px; padding-left:20px;">
                     I was not aware of the existence of alternative products that may have been priced more reasonably.
                     </p>
                     </li>
                  </ol>
                  <li style="margin-top:10px;">
                  <p style="color:#45484f; margin:0px; padding-left:20px;">
                     As a result of the above I wish to claim back the undisclosed commission from the Defendant. To this end,
                     I am seeking to obtain Judgment for a sum which equates to a total refund of the amount which I paid in
                     PPI premiums, contractual interest and charges, together with compensatory interest to be calculated at a
                     rate determined by the Court, from the date of my first PPI premium payment until the date of trial, less
                     any redress payment already paid.
                  </p></li>
